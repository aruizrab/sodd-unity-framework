# Installation

To integrate the **SODD Framework** into your Unity project, follow these steps:

1. In your project, open the Package Manager by going to `Window` > `Package Manager`.
2. In the Package Manager, click on the `+` icon in the top left corner and select '**Add package from git URL**'. For
   more detailed instructions, see
   the [Unity documentation on installing from a Git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.2/Documentation/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html).
3. Enter the following URL into the text field and click '**Add**':
   ```
   https://github.com/aruizrab/sodd-unity-framework.git
   ```

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The SODD Framework requires
> Unity's [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@1.8/manual/index.html) package. If it is
> not already installed in your project, Unity will prompt you to install it as a dependency when adding the SODD
> Framework.

Once the above steps are completed, the latest version of the SODD Framework will appear in your project packages list,
indicating successful installation.
