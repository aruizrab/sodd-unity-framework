# Theory behind the SODD Framework

## Context

Unity developers often face [challenges](problems.md) related to dependency management and interactions between systems
within their projects. These issues, if not addressed adequately, can lead to complex and rigid game structures,
hindering scalability and maintainability.

It is in this context that Ryan Hipple, principal engineer of Schell Games, introduces in
the [Unite Austin conference of 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk) a novel approach to game development
employing ScriptableObjects. [Hipple’s proposal](game-architecture.md) advocates for a more modular and manageable game
architecture in Unity, harnessing the potential of ScriptableObjects to mitigate common development challenges.
