# SODD Unity Framework

Welcome to the SODD Unity Framework, a robust tool for architecting your games using ScriptableObjects in Unity.

# Introduction

## Overview of the SODD Framework

The ScriptableObject Driven Development (SODD) Framework is an innovative and efficient approach to game development in
Unity, designed to enhance modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Building on the foundational concepts
introduced by Ryan Hipple at the [Unite Austin conference in 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raQ3iHhE_Kk), the
SODD Framework leverages the power of
ScriptableObjects to streamline the development process and overcome common challenges associated with traditional
MonoBehaviour-centric architectures.

ScriptableObjects in Unity provide a robust way to manage data independently of the GameObjects in the scene, promoting
a more organized and decoupled system. By encapsulating game events, variables, and collections within
ScriptableObjects, the SODD Framework enables developers to create self-contained, reusable components that can be
easily managed and modified without directly affecting other parts of the game.

## Benefits and Applications

The SODD Framework offers several key benefits that make it a valuable tool for both independent developers and large
development teams:

- **Modularity**: The framework allows for the creation of independent, self-contained game components. This reduces
  interdependencies and makes it easier to manage and update individual parts of the game without impacting the entire
  system. Modular components can be reused across different projects, saving development time and effort.
- **Editability**: With ScriptableObjects, game data can be easily modified through the Unity Inspector, enabling rapid
  prototyping and iterative development. Designers and developers can adjust game parameters on the fly, without needing
  to dive into the codebase, thus enhancing flexibility and responsiveness during the development process.
- **Debuggability**: The framework includes features for logging and tracking events and data changes, which simplifies
  debugging and testing processes. By maintaining clear and detailed logs of event invocations and variable updates,
  developers can quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring a smoother development experience.
- **Scalability**: The decoupled nature of ScriptableObjects allows for scalable game architectures. As the game grows
  in complexity, the framework ensures that new features and systems can be added without causing significant
  disruptions to the existing structure.

## Purpose and Goals

The primary goal of the SODD Framework is to provide a comprehensive toolset that enhances productivity and
collaboration in Unity’s development environment. By offering a structured approach to managing game data and events,
the framework aims to:

1. **Simplify Dependency Management**: Reduce the complexity of interactions between different game systems, making it
   easier to maintain and expand the game over time.
2. **Enhance Collaboration**: Enable designers, developers, and other team members to work more effectively by providing
   clear interfaces and tools for modifying game behavior and data.
3. **Improve Code Quality**: Promote best practices in game engineering, such as modularity, data-driven design, and
   event-driven architecture, to create cleaner, more maintainable codebases.

## Target Audience

The SODD Framework is designed for a wide range of Unity developers, from beginners to seasoned professionals. Whether
you are an indie developer working on a small project or part of a large team developing a complex game, the framework
provides the tools and methodologies to improve your development process. Familiarity with Unity and C# programming is
recommended to fully leverage the capabilities of the SODD Framework.
